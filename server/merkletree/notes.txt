Notes
- 0 is not a valid epoch (1 is the first epoch)

CoW scheme
- Child pointers contain epoch number
- We build up the tree for a new epoch in-memory:
    - We lazy-load nodes that are accessed; nodes store childHashes so sibling nodes are not accessed
    - Set() doesn't need to set epoch numbers or hashes, since flush() does it
    - flush() creates a new epoch, writing out all of loaded nodes with the new epoch number


Questions
- Where to put utils & node hashing (hash.go)?
- Cache nodes in-memory? Currently we do not (but LevelDB caches)
- Cleaner way to do in-memory nodes that don't need to deal with epoch numbers?
    - Would have to change flush() so that it doesn't write out all the chached nodes
